# WaveRNN

Pytorch implementation of Deepmind's WaveRNN model from [Efficient Neural Audio Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08435v1)

### This is very much a work in progress

It's early days so there are just a couple of toy experiments online for now. The next couple of notebooks will be mainly concerned with speeding up the training (currently @ 0.5 batches/second) and  implementing local conditioning.
